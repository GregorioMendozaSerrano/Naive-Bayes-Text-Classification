The comparison between pre-/post-treatment groups was performed by modified paired T-test using the limma package. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) Samples were tested for ALK rearrangements by FISH (Vysis ALK Break Apart FISH Probe Kit) as previously described30. Gene expression analysis RNA from cell lines and controls was prepared labeled and hybridized to Illumina HT-12 array. For analysis the sample probe profile data in the GeneSpring export format was transformed to log-2 scale and normalized using quantile method by applying beadarray package31 in BioConductor 2.11. Four duplicated samples were averaged to reduce the total sample size to 9 across three groups. The comparison between drug sensitive and drug resistant groups was performed using limma package. The significantly changed probes were identified by moderated t statistics. The p-values from moderated t-tests were adjusted by Benjamini and Hochberg's method to control false discovery rate. The microarray data reported in this  have been deposited in NCBI's Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo (Accession no.

Xenograft studies Nude mice (nu/nu; Harlan Laboratories) were used for in vivo studies and were cared for in accordance with guidelines approved by the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and Research Animal Resource Center. 8 week old female mice were injected subcutaneously with 5 million H3122 cells together with matrigel. Once tumors reached an average volume of 100 mm3 mice were randomized to the different treatment cohorts. For the experiment in Supplementary Fig. 1f mice were randomized to receive either crizotinib alone MAb391 alone crizotinib + MAb391 or vehicle control (n = 6 for vehicle alone crizotinib and crizotinib + MAb391. n = 5 for MAb391 only). Crizotinib was administered at 50 mg kg?1 p.o. daily \\u0097 5 days. MAb391 was administered at 1 mg i.p. every 3 days. For the experiment in Fig. 6b mice were randomized to receive crizotinib alone (50 mg kg?1 p.o. daily \\u0097 5 days) LDK-378 alone (50 mg kg?1 p.o. daily \\u0097 5 days) or vehicle control (n = 5 for Crizotinib and LDK-378 n = 4 for vehicle control). Mice were observed daily throughout the treatment period for signs of morbidity/mortality. Tumors were measured twice weekly using calipers and volume was calculated using the formula: length \\u0097 width2 \\u0097 0.52. Body weight was also assessed twice weekly. P values were determined with the Wilcoxon Rank Sum test. EML4-ALK (E13;A20) transgenic mice Genetically engineered mice harboring the EML4-ALK E13;A20 fusion variant has been previously reported13. Three month old mice from both genders were used in the described studies. All animal treatment studies were reviewed and approved by the IACUC at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. Tumor Biopsy Samples All patient tumor biopsy samples were obtained under Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved protocols (Vanderbilt University IRB# 050644 Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center IRB #10-136 University Hospital of Cologne IRB #06037 Peter MacCallum Cancer Center IRB#08/71). Written informed consent was obtained from all patients. All samples were deidentified and protected health information was reviewed according to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) guidelines. For the index patient's tumor clinical genotyping was performed using the SNaPshot platform as previously described32. Immunohistochemistry Tumors were pathologically identified and classified according to WHO guidelines. Briefly 3 ?m thick sections of FFPE tumors were deparaffinized. For pIGF-1R staining antigen retrieval was performed by boiling the section in citrate buffer at pH 6 for 25 minutes. For IRS-1 staining no pretreatment was necessary. Primary antibodies were used as follows: pIGF-1R (pY1161) (Ab39398 1:100 pH 6 Abcam Inc.) IRS-1 (Ab40777 1:100 Abcam Inc.). Corresponding secondary antibodies and detection kits were used (Enhancer: post antibody blocking for Bright Vision plus; Immuno Logic c-DPVB blocking and Polymer: Poly-HRP-GAM/R/R IgG; Immuno Logic c-DPVB999HRP BrightVision+ cat #DPVB999HRP ImmunoLogic Duiven The Netherlands www.immunologic.nl) and stained on an automated stainer (LabVision Autostainer 480S Thermo Scientific). Staining intensities were individually evaluated by 3 independent observers.

Background Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide and characterized by a poor prognosis. It has a major impact on the psychological wellbeing of patients and their partners. Recently it has been shown that Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) is effective in reducing anxiety and depressive symptoms in cancer patients. The generalization of these results is limited since most participants were female patients with breast cancer. Moreover only one study examined the effectiveness of MBSR in partners of cancer patients. Therefore in the present trial we study the effectiveness of MBSR versus treatment as usual (TAU) in patients with lung cancer and their partners. Methods/Design A parallel group randomized controlled trial is conducted to compare MBSR with TAU. Lung cancer patients who have received or are still under treatment and their partners are recruited. Assessments will take place at baseline post intervention and at three-month follow-up. The primary outcome is psychological distress (i.e. anxiety and depressive symptoms). Secondary outcomes are quality of life (only for patients) caregiver appraisal (only for partners) relationship quality and spirituality. In addition cost-effectiveness ratio (only in patients) and several process variables are assessed. Discussion This trial will provide information about the clinical and cost-effectiveness of MBSR compared to TAU in patients with lung cancer and their partners. Trial registration ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01494883. Mindfulness-based stress reduction Lung cancer patients Partners Psychological distress Randomized controlled trial Background With an estimated 1.4 million deaths per year lung cancer is the leading cause of death by cancer worldwide. Even with the best available treatment five-year survival is merely 16% and about 60 to 70% of patients die within the first year after diagnosis [1]. This poor prognosis is often caused by a late diagnosis as the presentation usually occurs when the lung cancer is advanced. Patients may develop burdensome symptoms like pain dyspnoea fatigue and cough and they may undergo radical treatment including surgery chemo- and radiotherapy. Not surprisingly lung cancer has a major impact on the psychological wellbeing of patients and their family. Akechi and colleagues [2] showed that 19% of patients with advanced lung cancer meets the criteria of psychiatric disorders especially depressive and adjustment disorders. Of patients who had been successfully treated for lung cancer 15% met the criteria for a minor or major depressive disorder [3]. The prevalence rate of depressive and anxiety symptoms among lung cancer patients ranges from 20 to 47% [4-7]. Compared to patients with other cancer diagnoses lung cancer patients report the highest rates of distress (43 to 58%) [89] resulting in a lower quality of life [10]. Family friends and especially partners of patients with lung cancer also have to deal with its psychological impact [11-14]. Partners not only provide emotional and practical support they also have to cope with their own concerns including the uncertainty regarding the course of the illness and the fear of losing their partner [15]. More than 50% of partners of lung cancer patients report negative emotional effects of caregiving [16]. Around 40% of partners of patients with advanced lung cancer report high levels of distress [17]. The relationship between patient and partner can also be affected by the cancer. It has been shown that some partners report a lower quality of their relationship after the diagnosis of lung cancer [18]. Though numerous studies examined the psychological distress of lung cancer patients and their partners [2-22] not much research is done on how to alleviate distress in these groups [23]. In addition the available studies on managing the psychosocial care needs of cancer patients and their families have focused on care at the very end of life (e.g. [24-26]). Recently studies have demonstrated that palliative care initiated early in treatment improves the quality of life and depressive symptoms of lung cancer patients [1027]. This stresses the importance of integrating psychosocial care for lung cancer patients and their partners early in the treatment rather than instigating it once life-prolonging therapies fail. In the past ten years MBSR has become a promising psychosocial intervention for cancer patients. Mindfulness is defined as intentionally paying attention to moment-by-moment experiences in a non-judgmental way [28]. MBSR is an 8-week group-based training consisting of meditation practices such as the bodyscan gentle yoga sitting and walking meditation. By repeatedly bringing attention back to the current experience participants gradually learn to disengage from dysfunctional thoughts and directly experience the emotions and bodily sensations of the present moment. MBSR aims to provide participants with the ability to step back from ruminating about the past or worrying about the future and simply allow experiences to unfold [2829]. A recent meta-analysis [30] of 13 nonrandomized studies and 9 randomized controlled trials (RCT) concluded there is positive evidence for the use of mindfulness-based interventions in reducing psychological distress in cancer patients. Among the RCT\\u0099s a reduction in symptom severity was found for both anxiety and depression corresponding to moderate pooled controlled effect sizes (Hedges\\u0099s g = 0.37 and Hedges\\u0099s g = 0.44 respectively) [30]. Though mindfulness-based interventions seem to be effective the authors note that across studies the majority of participants were women (85%) and diagnosed with breast cancer (77%). Compared to breast cancer patients patients with lung cancer are more often male older and have a poorer prognosis. Furthermore of these 22 studies only one study included the partners of the patients showing that partners also benefit from the MBSR training [31]. This is quite surprising since partners of cancer patients also report high levels of distress [32]. Aims The aim of the Mindfulness for Lung Oncology Nijmegen (MILON) study is to examine the effectiveness of MBSR compared to TAU in reducing psychological distress in patients with lung cancer and their partners. We hypothesize that patients in the MBSR group will report a lower level of psychological distress (i.e. anxiety and depressive symptoms) higher levels of quality of life quality of relationship and spirituality than those in the TAU group. Medical and societal costs will be lower in the MBSR versus TAU group. We expect partners in the MBSR group to report a lower level of psychological distress and higher levels of caregiver appraisal relationship quality and spirituality than their counterparts in the TAU group. With regard to the working mechanisms of the MBSR programme we will examine changes in mindfulness skills self-compassion rumination intrusion avoidance and adherence to MBSR. Methods/Design Study design The design of the \\u0098MILON\\u0099 study is a parallel group randomized controlled trial with an embedded process study. Participants are randomized between MBSR and TAU. The study protocol has been approved by our ethical review board (CMO Arnhem-Nijmegen) and registered under number 2011\\u0093519.

disinfecting method of sprayinginjecting disinfectant is not applied to surface disinfectionbecause it causes aerosol infection increased riskof inhalation and the range of contact between thedisinfectant and the surface is insufficient so thedisinfecting effect is insufficient Disinfectant hazard information must be checkedand used carefully Do not mix different disinfectants Do not
